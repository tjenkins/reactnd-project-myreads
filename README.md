# MyReads Project

This is my final project submission for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This app allows a user to search for books and add them to different shelves for "Currently Reading", "Want To Read", and "Read". The user can move books between shelves as well as remove books from the shelves altogether.

## Running the app

To run the app, follow these instructions:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
